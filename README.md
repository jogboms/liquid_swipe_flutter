## Getting Started
* Add this to your pubspec.yaml
  ```
  dependencies:
  liquid_swipe: ^1.4.0
  
  ```
* Get the package from Pub:

  ```
  flutter packages get
  ```
* Import it in your file

  ```
  import 'package:liquid_swipe/liquid_swipe.dart';
  ```
  
## Usage

 - *`Liquid Swipe`* just requires the list of [`containers`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Container-class.html). Just to provide flexibity to the developer to design its own view through it.
 ```
 final pages = [
    Container(...),
    Container(...),
    Container(...),
  ];
 ```
 
 * Now just pass these pages to LiquidSwipe widget.
 ```
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return new MaterialApp(
      home: Builder(
          builder: (context) =>
              LiquidSwipe(
                  pages: pages
              )),
    );
  }
 ```
